## About the application

This Android application has been developed for facilitating hostel students at VIT vellore to register their complaints effectively across different categories : 1.Room Cleaning
                                                     2.Maintainance
                                                     3. Mess related
                                                     4.Other
Additionally, a unique QR code generator for Night Library slips has been implemented with real timestamp generation.
The QR stores information about the student and their student ID when scanned and displays them in a text file.
Seperate sign-up pages have been created for both employers and students.
Employers can signup and resolve the student's queries about hostel amenities.
#Tech Stack Used: Flutter
