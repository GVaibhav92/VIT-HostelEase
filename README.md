## About the application

This Android application has been developed to facilitate hostel students at VIT Vellore to register their complaints effectively across different categories: 
                                                                                                                                                              1. Room Cleaning
                                                                                                                                                              2. Maintainance
                                                                                                                                                              3. Mess related
                                                                                                                                                              4. Other
                                                     
A unique QR code generator for Night Library slips has also been implemented with real timestamp generation.
When scanned, the QR stores information about the student and their student ID and displays them in a text file.

Separate sign-up pages have been created for both employers and students.
Employers can signup and resolve the student's queries about hostel amenities.

#Tech Stack Used: Flutter
#IDE used: VSCode

The application can be run cross-platform on an Android emulator or by simply debugging the VSCode terminal to run in the local host.
